Our Hero, our Hero claims a warrior's heart
I tell you, I tell you the Dragonborn comes
With a voice wielding power of ancient Nord Art
Believe, believe the Dragonborn comes
It's an end to the evil, of all Skyrim's foes
Beware, beware the Dragonborn comes
For the darkness has passed and the legend yet grows
You'll know, you'll know Dragonborn's come.
